abstract: "This presentation offers a comprehensive overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models, setting the stage for an exploration of three fronts I think are critical for the future: Democratic AI, Sustainable AI, and Redistributive AI. For each of these areas, I present some current challenges and and propose some potential solutions. The talk aims to stimulate thought and discussion on how we can guide AI development to ensure it benefits society as a whole."
