abstract: "There are traditionally two ways of seeing a Variational Autoencoder: as an autoencoder that uses variational inference loss, or as a variational inference algorithm that uses an autoencoder as the underlying architecture.  I like the later, which comes from a more probabilistic school and gives (in my opinion) a better understanding of what is going on."
