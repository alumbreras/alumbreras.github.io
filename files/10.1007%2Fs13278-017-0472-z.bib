abstract="Some structural characteristics of online discussions have been successfully modeled in the recent years. When parameters of these models are properly estimated, the models are able to generate synthetic discussions that are structurally similar to the real discussions. A common aspect of these models is that they consider that all users behave according to the same model. In this paper, we combine a growth model with an Expectation--Maximization algorithm that finds different parameters for different latent groups of users. We use this method to find the different roles that coexist in the community. Moreover, we analyze whether we can predict users behaviors based on their roles. Indeed, we show that predictions are improved for some of the roles when compared with a simple growth model.",

abstract="We present a dual-view mixture model to cluster users based on their features and latent behavioral functions. Every component of the mixture model represents a probability density over a feature view for observed user attributes and a behavior view for latent behavioral functions that are indirectly observed through user actions or behaviors. Our task is to infer the groups of users as well as their latent behavioral functions. We also propose a non-parametric version based on a Dirichlet Process to automatically infer the number of clusters. We test the properties and performance of the model on a synthetic dataset that represents the participation of users in the threads of an online forum. Experiments show that dual-view models outperform single-view ones when one of the views lacks information.",
