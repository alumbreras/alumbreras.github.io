                    <h3>Analyzing the neighborhoods of user posts</h3>

<small><a href="../drafts/2015-01-14-Podemitas_motifs.html">Posted on January 14, 2015</a></small>

<p>In this post (work in progress), I will cluster Podemos forum users according to the graphs around their posts. The idea is to find which groups of users tend to participate (more than the average) in cascades, which ones tend to participate (more than the average) in stars, and son on.</p>
<p>As in the previous post, I will use the threads written on January 2015 on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/podemos">Reddit subforum of Podemos</a>. The podemos forum (a.k.a subreddit) contains 995 discussion threads that started on January. These threads contain a total of 12912 posts written by 1218 users.</p>
<h4 id="discussion-trees">Discussion trees</h4>
<p>A very natural to represent a conversation thread is a tree where vertices represent posts and edges represent replies from some post to another. Let us see some of the discussions of our dataset:</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<h4 id="motifs-in-discussion-trees">Motifs in discussion trees</h4>
<p>Imagine we take one post <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> as well as it neighborhood of posts and we create a graph from that. I will call this subgraph a <code>motif</code>. I would like to count, for every user, the different motifs around their posts given a neighborhood radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Unfortunatelly this concept of neighborhood based on distances has an infinite number of possible graphs. Both trees in the below image represent two possible neighborhoods of the red vertex (the white vertex represents the root post of the thread):</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../images/2015-01-15-large_neighborhood.png" width="300px"> <img src="../images/2015-01-15-short_neighborhood.png" width="300px">
</p>
<!---OLD: if the original neighborhood has more than $M$ vertices we will keep only the $M$ that are closest in time to the post $p$.-->
<p>To reduce our space of possible neighborhoods we will introduce the concept of <em>temporal neighborhood</em>: if post $p was written at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the temporal neighborhood (of radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>) of a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the set of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> posts in its <em>spacial neighborhood</em> that were written in a time closest to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (and where closeness is computed as <span class="math inline">\(|t_i-t|\)</span>) and where the posts in the shortest path from each neighbour and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> belong also to the <em>temporal neighborhood</em>.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we count the <em>temporal neighborhoods</em> of every user’s posts. To make it funnier (and more fine-grained), we will also put a color (white) on the root post. For a spacial neighborhood of radius <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and a temporal neighborhood of radius <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> we obtain:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../images/2016-01-15-motifs_1_4.png" width="600px">
</p>
<p>We can play the the spacial and the temporal radius. Let’s see what happens if we set both radius to <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>:</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>where I named the neighborhoods to help the intuition.</p>
<p>(<strong>Question</strong>: how come <em>spot</em> is the most frequent? How is it possible to have no neighbors at all? Or what might be wrong?)</p>
<h4 id="types-of-conversationalists">Types of conversationalists</h4>
<p>Given the neighborhoods in which each user participates, we will analyze whether there exists different types of users or all users look similar. Since</p>
<p>Since we want to make the analyse independent of the number of posts, we will normalize each user feature vector so that features indicate the percentage of posts in this kind of neighborhood. Moreover, some neighborhoods are much more common than others due to the nature of the forums. Thus, we normalize and scale the features so that every feature has a global mean 0 and variance 1. The features represent now <em>z-scores</em>, that is, how many standard deviations is this user feature away from the mean.</p>
We will use a simple <em>k-means</em> to find the clusters. To decide the number of clusters, we run <em>k-means</em> for <span class="math inline">\(k=2,...,10\)</span> clusters and looked at the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares.
<p align="center">
<img src="../images/2016-01-15-elbow2.png" width="600px">
</p>
This plot suggests a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> between 3 and 5. I will choose 5 to keep thinks simple. I run the k-means and then plot the scatter matrix of evert pair of variables, where colors correspond to the clusters.

To see it more clearly, let’s plot a PCA projection over the first two components:
<p align="center">

</p>
<h3 id="making-sense-of-it">Making sense of it</h3>
Let us make a closer inspection on the characteristics of each group to understand what are these groups and to see whether the results make sense. Let’s go take a look again at the PCA (with another library):

</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../images/2016-01-15-whiskers.png" width="800px">
</p>
<p>Let’s now formalize the detected groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spotters (pink)</strong>: this people seems to be ignore by their peers. A lot of them are probably newbies.</li>
<li><strong>Common Answerers</strong> (yellow): this people prefer to participate by answering to the root posts raised some interest (CA3 motif)</li>
<li><strong>Chain Common Bifurcators</strong> (green): this people participates deeper in the discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamizers</strong> (blue) (High CCB CIA SA): they are seen at the begining of chains and in bifurcations, suggesting that they are people that know the community and that are not ignored by their peers.</li>
<li><strong>Common People</strong>: this group of people represents the average person. They do not stand out in any feature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we assigned a role to every user, let’s see what is the proportion of roles in every thread. We will</p>
