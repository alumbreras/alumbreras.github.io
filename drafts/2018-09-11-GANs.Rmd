## Introduction

In statistics, we often hear that an estimator is biased or unbiased. In this post, I will introduce the definition of bias and then I will work through a couple of 
examples (with R code!). I will always consider that we want to approximate an expectation, since this is a very common problem in Machine Learning. However, the same ideas can be applied to estimations of other quantities (e.g.: higher moments such as variances).
