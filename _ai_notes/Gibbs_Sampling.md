This article will cover Gibbs Sampling, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for sampling from complex multivariate probability distributions.

## Topics to cover:
- Introduction to Monte Carlo methods
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) basics
- The Gibbs sampling algorithm
- Conditional distributions and full conditionals
- Convergence properties and burn-in
- How Gibbs sampling works: the iterative process
- When to use Gibbs sampling
- Practical examples and applications
- Diagnosing convergence (trace plots, Gelman-Rubin statistic)
- Advantages and limitations
- Comparison with other MCMC methods (Metropolis-Hastings)
