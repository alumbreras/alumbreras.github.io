This article will cover approaches and considerations for training AI agents to perform complex tasks.

## Topics to cover:
- Pre-training vs fine-tuning for agents
- Instruction tuning for agent capabilities
- Reinforcement learning for agent training
- Learning from human feedback (RLHF) in agent context
- Curriculum learning for agents
- Synthetic data generation for training
- Evaluation metrics for agent performance
- Challenges in agent training (safety, alignment, robustness)
- Transfer learning and generalization
