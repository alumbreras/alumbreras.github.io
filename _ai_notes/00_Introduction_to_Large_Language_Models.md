🚧 **Work in progress...**

This chapter provides an overview of Large Language Models (LLMs), covering their architecture, training methodologies, and optimization techniques.

## What you'll learn in this chapter:

Large Language Models have revolutionized natural language processing and artificial intelligence. This chapter explores the fundamental concepts and advanced techniques that power modern LLMs.

### Core Concepts
- **Tokenization**: How text is converted into numerical representations that models can process
- **Attention Mechanisms**: The core innovation that enables models to focus on relevant parts of the input

### Training and Optimization
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks and domains
- **Alignment Methods**: Techniques for aligning model behavior with human preferences
  - **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Policy gradient methods for RLHF
  - **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)**: Simplified preference learning without reward models
  - **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**: Advanced policy optimization techniques
  - **RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback)**: Scaling alignment with synthetic feedback
  - **RLVF (Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Feedback)**: Alignment with verifiable correctness

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how LLMs are built, trained, and optimized for various applications.
