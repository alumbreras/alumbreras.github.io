This article will cover Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), a powerful class of generative models that combine deep learning with variational inference.

## Topics to cover:
- Introduction to autoencoders
- The generative modeling problem
- Variational inference framework for VAEs
- The reparameterization trick
- Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) in VAEs
- Encoder and decoder architectures
- Training VAEs
- Applications: image generation, representation learning
- Variants: β-VAE, Conditional VAE, Hierarchical VAE
- Comparison with other generative models (GANs, diffusion models)
