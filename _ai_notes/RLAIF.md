🚧 **Work in progress...**

This article will cover Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), an alternative to RLHF that uses AI models instead of humans to provide feedback for training language models.

## Topics to cover:
- Motivation: scaling beyond human feedback
- RLAIF framework and methodology
- AI-based reward modeling
- Comparison with RLHF
- Advantages and limitations
- Applications and results
