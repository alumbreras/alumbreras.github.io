This article will cover Reinforcement Learning from Visual Feedback (RLVF), a reinforcement learning approach that uses visual feedback to train agents.

## Topics to cover:
- Visual feedback in reinforcement learning
- RLVF framework and methodology
- Vision-based reward signals
- Applications in robotics and multimodal AI
- Comparison with traditional RL approaches
- Challenges and future directions
