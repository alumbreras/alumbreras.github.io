🚧 **Work in progress...**

This chapter explores AI agents—autonomous systems that can perceive, reason, and act to achieve goals in complex environments.

## What you'll learn in this chapter:

AI agents represent a paradigm shift from static models to dynamic, goal-oriented systems that can interact with the world. This chapter covers the fundamental concepts, architectural patterns, and training approaches for building effective agent systems.

### Foundations
- **What is an Agent?**: Understanding agent characteristics, autonomy, and the distinction from traditional AI systems
- **Structured Outputs and Tool Calling**: How agents interact with external systems through APIs and tools

### Architecture and Design
- **Agent Design Patterns**: Common patterns and best practices for building robust agent systems
  - ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)
  - Chain-of-Thought and planning strategies
  - Memory systems and context management
  - Multi-agent collaboration
  - Error recovery and safety patterns

### Training and Optimization
- **On Training Agents**: Approaches for training agents to perform complex tasks
  - Instruction tuning for agent capabilities
  - Reinforcement learning for agent behavior
  - Learning from feedback and evaluation metrics
  - Safety, alignment, and robustness considerations

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand how to design, build, and train AI agents that can autonomously solve complex tasks while maintaining safety and reliability.
