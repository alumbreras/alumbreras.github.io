🚧 **Work in progress...**

This article will cover Importance Sampling, a Monte Carlo technique for estimating expectations under one distribution using samples from another.

## Topics to cover:
- Motivation: when direct sampling is difficult
- The importance sampling principle
- Importance weights and the proposal distribution
- Mathematical formulation
- Estimating expectations with importance sampling
- Choosing good proposal distributions
- Effective sample size
- Self-normalized importance sampling
- Variance of importance sampling estimators
- When importance sampling works well (and when it doesn't)
- Applications in Bayesian inference
- Sequential importance sampling
- Relationship to other Monte Carlo methods
- Practical examples and implementation
