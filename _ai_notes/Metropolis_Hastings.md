🚧 **Work in progress...**

This article will cover the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a foundational Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for sampling from probability distributions.

## Topics to cover:
- Historical context and motivation
- The Metropolis algorithm (original version)
- The Metropolis-Hastings generalization
- Proposal distributions and their role
- Acceptance ratio and the acceptance-rejection step
- Detailed balance and reversibility
- Convergence to the target distribution
- Practical implementation
- Choosing good proposal distributions
- Applications in Bayesian inference
- Tuning the algorithm (acceptance rates)
- Comparison with Gibbs sampling
- Random walk vs. independence samplers
