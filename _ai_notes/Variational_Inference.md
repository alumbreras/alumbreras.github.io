This article will cover Variational Inference, a powerful technique for approximating posterior distributions in Bayesian inference when exact inference is intractable.

## Topics to cover:
- Introduction to Bayesian inference challenges
- The variational inference framework
- Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)
- Mean-field approximation
- Coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI)
- Applications and practical examples
