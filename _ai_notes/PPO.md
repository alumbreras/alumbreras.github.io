This article will cover Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm widely used for fine-tuning large language models with human feedback (RLHF).

## Topics to cover:
- Policy gradient methods
- Trust region optimization
- PPO algorithm and implementation
- Applications in LLM fine-tuning
