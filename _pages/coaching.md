## My coaching principles 

My coaching style is grounded in four key principles that will guide our journey together.

#### **Values**

My coachee's values are the foundation on which we build their goals and their vision for the future. Values help us to define what is important for them, and they provide a compass to guide their decisions and actions. I help my coachees to identify their values and to make sure that their actions are consistent with their values and their priorities.

#### **Co-creation**

The essence of our coaching relationship is grounded in co-creation. This means we collaborate closely to tailor strategies and solutions that uniquely fit my coachees needs. I bring my expertise and insights to the table, while you bring your unique experiences and perspectives. Our sessions will be interactive and dynamic, encouraging an open dialogue. This collaborative approach ensures that the insights and actions developed are deeply personalized, ensuring that they are not just effective but also meaningful and sustainable for the coachee.

#### **Accountability**

Accountability is a key pillar of our coaching engagement. I am committed to holding my coachees accountable to the goals we set together, providing a balanced mix of support and challenge. This involves regular check-ins, constructive feedback, and encouragement to stay on track. My role is to be a catalyst for their commitment and a support system for their journey, helping them navigate through obstacles and stay focused on their desired outcomes. This consistent accountability framework fosters progress and facilitates real change.

#### **Ambition** (and *exponential growth*)

I challenge my coachees to think big. I help them crafting a vision for their future that is both inspiring and achievable, and that deeply resonate with their values and their priorities, setting the stage for a transformative experience. Our journey involves uncovering their potential, leveraging their strengths, and confronting any barriers that might be hindering their progress. I like make my coaches dream of exponential growth (you can read my <a href="posts/a-digression-on-exponential-growth.html">digression on exponential growth</a>)

                <p class="review-opinion">"I'm an IT Ops Manager with 15+ years of experience in IT. I'm very organized and very used to work in a very dynamic and challenging environment. I was very new to the idea of coaching and to be 100% honest, quite sceptical at first! Coaching sessions with Alberto were very enjoyable and professional. Alberto quickly helped me to understand the idea behind coaching as well as assuring I benefit from the experience. The sessions were <b>tailored for my needs</b> and I've got insight into interesting methodologies I was not previously familiar with. The sessions <b>helped me to structure my work</b> calendar better, tighten my organization and prioritization allowing for a <b>better work balance</b>, and to adjust my approach to learning and development for a <b>better chance of success</b>."</p>

                <p class="review-opinion">"Alberto has been crucial in my growth process. Right from the start we defined a list of goals and modeled the coaching sessions on them. Alberto has the ability to listen to you and ask the right questions at the right time almost as if he were a psychologist. Thanks to him, we were able to achieve the goals we set at the beginning of the process, and I am grateful to Alberto for <b>unlocking new skills that I will carry with me for the rest of my life</b>."</p>
