* Speaker: Hang Nguyen (PhD student at LAAS)

## Preliminaries
* A markov Decision Process is a five tuple: state space, action space, set of available actions, reward R, policy?

* Value function: 
$$
V_\pi= \mathbb{E}(R | s_0)\\
argmax V_\pi \text{(optimal value function)}
$$

* The update rules in RL have a Monte Carlo justification

## Temporal Difference Learning

## Function Apprximation

## Deep RL

## Continuous DQN

## Multi-Agents Discussion
